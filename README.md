===============

Scripts for rendering gaussian beams in POV-ray
pov-ray and documentation is available here for linux/windows (mac?):
http://www.povray.org/

Definitions used for the gaussian beam propagation can be found here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_beam

I'll be working on making this into an actual library, instead of just object definitions, at some point when I have the time.
Until then if you're interested get in touch at <nic.rss at gmail.com>

Feel free to share.
